# Draft Agenda for Call 0

Primary date Sep 11, Noon EST

Backup date for AB members who can not make the primary date:
Sep 13, 8AM EST

## Items on the agenda

1. WoC Background

A brief overview of what weâ€™re trying to accomplish with WoC (how to
make it into a resource for the whole SE research community). 

Our plans for the hackathon.

2. How would the AB like to interact?

In addition to an annual FtF meeting, would it make sense to have a
slack channel, or some other asynchronous mechanism where people
could post ideas and questions? 

3. Community outreach

Are there other ways, e.g., workshop at ICSE'20, that we should interact with
the wider SE research community?

What else can we do to build a community and make sure WoC is as
useful to the community as possible? 

4. After the hackathon, would AB be willing to give advice on
   prioritizing ideas that arise from the hackathon 


## Agenda

### What is WoC: in a nutshell

    1. Tool dependencies (to build/test applications)
    1. Code migration
	1. Knowledge (and people) migration
- Data Cleaned/Augmented/Contextualized
	1. Correction: Authors/Forks/Outliers
    1. Augmentation: Dependencies
	1. Context: project types/expertise
- Analytics
    1. Map entities to all related entities efficiently
- Timely
    1. Targeting < 1 week old analyzable snapshot of the entire FLOSS	


- Why community
    1. Do research that supports/uses FLOSS
