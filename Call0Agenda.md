## Detailed Agenda


###. AB Statements

- For each AB member
    1. Do you use open source data?
    1. What are the limitations you are experiencing? 
    1. What improvements in data availability would you like to see?
	1. Would the ability to capture the slice of OSS that is not
        repository focused be useful?
	1. Other needs?


### What is WoC: in a nutshell

Objective: focus on hard/expensive work a research team can not
afford to enable research on global properties of FLOSS

- Census of all FLOSS
    1. What is out there, of what kind, how much
- FLOSS-wide relationships
    1. Technical dependencies (to run applications)
    1. Tool dependencies (to build/test applications)
    1. Code migration
	1. Knowledge (and people) migration
- Data Cleaned/Augmented/Contextualized
	1. Correction: Authors/Forks/Outliers
    1. Augmentation: Dependencies
	1. Context: project types/expertise
- Analytics
    1. Map entities to all related entities efficiently
- Timely
    1. Targeting < 1 week old analyzable snapshot of the entire FLOSS	


- Why community
    1. Do research that supports/uses FLOSS
    1. Enhance infrastructure (an ecosystem of infrastructures)
    1. Build tools that support FLOSS
	
### Hackathon

- Register: bit.ly/WoC-Hack

    1. Needed to provide you an account on servers/add to gh/bb groups
    1. Give at least one sentence description of what the
       participant wants to do
    1. Please encourage participants to join the webinar (mid Oct,
       data TBD) or at least
       look over the recording
    1. Draft tutorial at:  https://github.com/woc-hack/tutorial

### How would the AB like to interact?

In addition to an annual FtF meeting, would it make sense to have a
slack channel, or some other asynchronous mechanism where people
could post ideas and questions? 

Slack: bit.ly/WoC-Signup
github.com/WoC-hack 

Do we need subgroups with specific interests, would some AB (or
non-AB) members want to become more actively involved? 

Would it make sense to run WoC as an open source project (e.g., inviting and vetting contributions, for 
example)?

If so who from AB would like to participate?

What licenses to use for code/data to foster community?

After the hackathon, would AB be willing to give advice on
prioritizing ideas that arise from the hackathon 

### Community outreach

Are there other ways, e.g., workshop at ICSE'20, that we should interact with
the wider SE research community?

What else can we do to build a community and make sure WoC is as
useful to the community as possible?
